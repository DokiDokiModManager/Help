## It's the big localisation update!

In this release, we have translations for:

* Belarusian
* German
* Japanese
* Russian
* Spanish (Latin America)

as well as partial support for Norwegian Bokm√•l.

### Languages menu

There's now a language selector menu! Click the globe icon at the top of your screen, select your perferred language and restart. This feature is fairly basic as most of the development effort is going into v4, which has a much fancier language selector.
