# v4.3.0 Changelog

* Fixed issues with mods using the "DDMM v1" packaging format and bundled Ren'Py versions.
* Added a mod installation special cases feature - mods can now be remotely hotfixed to work without application updates.
* Removed a prehistoric hard-coded special case for DDLC the Normal VN, that should have been gone in 2018. Oops.
