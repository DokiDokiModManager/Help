# v4.0.0 Changelog

Welcome to Doki Doki Mod Manager 4! It's been a while. Here's a list of the new changes!

## Mods tab
New in DDMM 4 is the Mods tab! Your downloaded mods now live here, along with the featured mods and the brand new mod store, powered by the [DokiDokiModClub.com](https://dokidokimodclub.com) mod database. Find and install more mods than ever before!

## Mod categories
A highly requested feature, you can now move your installed mods into categories, allowing for easier sorting. You can keep completed mods separate from the ones that are in progress, or sort them by character - it’s up to you.

## Monika After Story integration
Want to take Monika on a trip out? DDMM now has a special option for taking Monika out with you without having to trawl through the game files to find her character file. DDMM will remember that you’ve taken Monika with you, so you can bring her home and carry on with ease.

## Backgrounds
After many requests, custom backgrounds are now available! Select any image you want for your background. You can also choose to allow mods to display themed backgrounds when you click on them.

Mod developers can provide their own backgrounds, or you can take screenshots in game and those will be used instead.

## Interface overhaul
I’ve gone through every menu, popup and button and made significant changes where necessary to make sure DDMM’s interface is consistent and pleasant to use. Gone are the confusing full screen text inputs and ugly context menus!

## New website
The [Doki Doki Mod Manager website](https://doki.space) is now cleaner, faster and has more information. Check it out!

## Behind the scenes: App restructure
DDMM is now fundamentally split into two separate components: the user interface and the app logic. This not only makes development easier for me, but also means your experience is faster and more stable. Small updates to the user interface and translations can also be done without having to download a whole new app version, saving your bandwidth and time!

## Behind the scenes: Electron upgrade
DDMM version 4 brings in a massive version jump to Electron 9. Almost every other dependency has been upgraded too!
