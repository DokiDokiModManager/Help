# v3.2.0 Changelog

Welcome to Doki Doki Mod Manager v3.2.0!

## What's new?

This release marks the start of a whole new set of features for Doki Doki Mod Manager!

### Doki Doki Mod Manager accounts

You can now sign in to Doki Doki Mod Manager using your email address. Doing this allows you to use some brand new features!
Click "Log In" at the top of the app.

### Preference Syncing (available now!)

Every device you log in to will share the same app background.

### Cloud Saves (in development)

Want to keep your mods in sync across multiple devices? Cloud save files allow you to do just that - close the game on one computer,
open it on another, and your game will be exactly how you left it!

This feature is in v3.2.0 but not enabled, as I am still working on some features (such as UI design) - if you want to test it out,
let me know on the [DDMM Discord](https://doki.space/discord).

### New localisation - Spanish (Latin America)

Thanks to **CGP Yuri** for contributing these translations!
