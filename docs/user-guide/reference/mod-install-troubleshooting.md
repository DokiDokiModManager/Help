# Fix mod installation problems

Although rare, sometimes errors can occur when installing mods. If you're having an issue with mods, use this article to find the cause and/or fix for your problem.

## An error message appears during installation.

This usually means something is wrong with the mod you're trying to install. Here are a few of the most common errors.

### `Error: end of central directory record signature not found`

This means the mod you downloaded (`.zip`) contains corrupted data. You will need to download the mod again. If you get the same error after downloading the mod a second time, please ask for help through the support contacts on the **About** tab.

### `Error: Command failed`

This _usually_ means the mod (`.rar` or `.7z`) you downloaded contains corrupted data. You will need to download the mod again. If you get the same error after downloading the mod a second time, please ask for help through the support contacts on the **About** tab.

### Other errors

Please ask for help through the support contacts on the **About** tab. For the fastest response, [Discord](https://doki.space/discord) is preferred.

## You are able to install your mod without any visible errors. However, when you launch the game, you see the regular DDLC splash screen, and the mod has not installed.

This is a rarer issue encountered when installing certain mods, or when the file selected isn't a mod at all.

### Check you selected the correct file

Doki Doki Mod Manager accepts `.zip`, `.rar` and `.7z` archive files. If you selected the wrong file, it will still try to install the contents of it as if it were a mod. Make sure you selected the mod you wanted to install, and try installing again.

### Mod-specific problems 

If you still can't install the mod properly, this may mean the mod author packaged it in a way that Doki Doki Mod Manager can't understand.

If you're the author of the mod, check the [packaging guidelines](mod-packaging.md) for best practices. If you're just trying to play the mod, your first point of contact should **not** be the mod author. Please join the [Doki Doki Mod Manager Discord](https://doki.space/discord) and ask there first, so we can find the cause of the problem.

## You are able to install your mod, but the game crashes on startup or at some point during gameplay.

This is a significantly rarer issue, as it either means the mod has been only partially installed with some data missing, or the mod itself is broken.

Please ask for help in the [Discord](https://doki.space/discord) if you encounter one of these errors. Although this could indicate a problem with the mod itself, I want to avoid mod authors potentially receiving bug reports for issues caused by Doki Doki Mod Manager.
