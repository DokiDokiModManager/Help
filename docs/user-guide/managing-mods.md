# Managing mods

Doki Doki Mod Manager has many features that help you organise your mods. This article will go through the options you are most likely to use.

## Categories

You can organise your installed mods into categories to make finding them easier. On the **Play** tab, choose the mod you want and click the **Settings** button. Choose **Change Category** to open the category picker.
