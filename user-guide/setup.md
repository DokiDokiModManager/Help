Doki Doki Mod Manager is an application that runs on your computer, so you need to download and install it before getting started.

## Download

Visit [the DDMM homepage](https://doki.space) and download the latest version for your type of computer. On Windows, your download will be in the form of a `.exe` file, whereas it will be a `.AppImage` on Linux.

Once your download is done, open it from your file manager (you may need to use the terminal on Linux). Say yes to any prompts you may receive.

**Windows may warn you that DDMM is not commonly downloaded and may be unsafe. This is a false positive - choose "More Info" then "Run Anyway".**

Installation will take about a minute. After this, Doki Doki Mod Manager will appear in your programs menu, and the app will start for the first time.

## Setup

Doki Doki Mod Manager will prompt you to either download or find a copy of Doki Doki Literature Club. If you've downloaded DDLC before from the [ddlc.moe](https://ddlc.moe) website, you may still have the game as a `.zip` file. If this is the case, click "Find a copy" and locate the game.

If you've played DDLC through Steam, or have never played the game before, click "Download" to start downloading a copy of the game. This will take a couple of minutes to half an hour, depending on your internet connection.
