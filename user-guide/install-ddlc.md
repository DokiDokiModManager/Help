title: Installing DDLC
---

After starting for the first time, you will be prompted to install DDLC.

## Basic Details

Choose a name for the install of the game. This could be the name of the mod you want to play, but can be anything you want. Type this in to the _Install Name_ box.

After you've entered a name, a folder name will be automatically generated, but you can change this if you want. Your installs can have the same name, but not the same folder name.

## Installing a Mod

**If you want to play vanilla (not modded) DDLC, you can skip this section.**

Check the _Install Mod_ checkbox. Another text box will appear - click this and select the mod you want to play. This should be in the form of a `.zip` file (other formats like `.rar` and `.7z` also work).

## Global Save

The final option you can choose is _Global Save_.

By default, each install of the game has its own save folder. This allows you to have multiple versions of the same mod installed without having them interfere with each other.

Enabling _Global Save_ disables this feature, and makes your mod save into the ordinary save folder. This allows you to continue a save game from a Steam copy of DDLC, for example.

Typically you will not want this enabled as it may cause issues with some mods.

## Install

Click _Install_ to start the installation process. This will take a few minutes, after which you will be taken to the installation overview.
